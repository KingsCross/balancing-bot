# balancing-bot

## Intro

This is just at attempt at programming a two-wheeled robot driven using two BotBrain continuous servos. It has an MPU 6050 IMU for finding error in pitch.

A PID controller is used.

Due to the rapid nature of this project, no effort was made to clean up the code. Perhaps I'll do this in the future :)
